# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-29)

**Core value:** A household's rooms are always at the right temperature at the
right time, without manual intervention — driven by schedules and who is
actually home. **Current focus:** Phase 9 — trv temperature offset auto calibration
presence schedules + TRV offset auto-calibration.

## Current Position

Phase: 9
Plan: Not started
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-05-30

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table. Recent decisions
affecting current work:

- v1.2 arch: person `schedule_type`/`schedule_even`/`schedule_odd` are additive
  — absent fields default to `single`, no storage migration needed

- v1.2 arch: even/odd week selected by ISO week parity
  (`date.isocalendar().week % 2`) at evaluation time

- v1.2 arch: single→even_odd seeds both week schedules from `schedule`;
  even_odd→single preserves `schedule` unchanged

- v1.2 arch: TRV calibration guarded by `temperature_offset` attribute /
  `tado_x.set_temperature_offset` service detection — incompatible or
  sensor-less rooms silently skipped

- v1.2 arch: calibration gated by configurable delta threshold (default 0.5°C)
  to prevent jitter

- Phase 9 (calibration) is independent of Phases 7-8 (scheduling) — can be
  planned/executed in parallel

### Pending Todos

- (cleared) TRV temperature offset auto-calibration — now scoped as Phase 9

### Blockers/Concerns

None yet.
